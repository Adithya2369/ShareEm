# ShareEm

In this project, we aim to develop a local file-sharing system that allows users to transfer files between
nearby devices on the same local network (LAN) without requiring an internet connection. This system is
inspired by applications like SHAREit and Xender and utilizes socket programming (TCP/UDP) for data
transmission.
